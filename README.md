## Notes on branching strategy

The branching strategy I'm using is the 'Git flow' strategy by Vincent Driessen, available [here](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). The [git-flow software package](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) is used to assist in this.

Commits prior to 21 Feb did not follow this model.
