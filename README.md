# Development of a map-based web application to be used by visitors and staff at the Dyfi Wildlife Centre

## Introduction

This repository contains all files pertaining to my assigned project for CS39440, the major project module at Aberystwyth University. The purpose of this project is to create a web app to be used by the [Dyfi Wildlife Centre](https://www.montwt.co.uk/projects/dyfi-wildlife-centre). The main parts of the app are:

- **Frontend** - A good design scheme should be used for the frontend of the program. Currently considering Material Design and Angular.
- **Backend** - A lightweight backend such as Node.js may be the best for the program, with perhaps a NoSQL solution like MongoDB being used for better efficiency.
- **APIs** - Google Cloud Platform has a good free tier that would be useful for this program, particularly the Map API.

## Journal

I am keeping a journal of what I have been doing on the project. This is good practice so I can keep note of my thoughts and actions and keep a good structure to the project. The link to this journal is [here](https://www.michaelmale.com/cs39440.html).
