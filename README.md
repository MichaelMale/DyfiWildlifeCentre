# CS39440 - Major Project

## Development of a map-based web application to be used by visitors and staff at the Dyfi Wildlife Centre

This repository includes work that I carried out as part of my major project at Aberystwyth University. The aim of the work was to develop an application for the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust's [Dyfi Wildlife Centre](https://www.montwt.co.uk/projects/dyfi-wildlife-centre). This is intended to be used on their displays to help guide users around the park. You can input coordinates or a postcode and will be able to see information on a screen.

The project itself also focused on an analysis of agile working practices and software engineering methods towards building a web application. Please note that much of the information on this page is outdated and the project itself is stale (though you could potentially run the application by changing the Google API keys and SQL settings), however I have decided to make the repo public as a demonstration of the work I carried out whilst a student at University. This was submitted as part of the 2019/20 intake and I have now graduated, if you have any queries specific to the module itself please contact [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/compsci).
