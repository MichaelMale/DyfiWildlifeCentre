\chapter{Implementation}

The implementation of the design of this application followed an iterative methodology, with builds moving slowly towards the design that has been described in the previous chapter. This chapter will break the application's development into distinct iterations, with the initial iteration being what was considered the Minimum Viable Product - that being that the software had fulfilled the essential requirements and its core functionality had been implemented. Each iteration will include a subsection, that defines what was included in the design at that point. The final iteration will have included all facets of the design.
