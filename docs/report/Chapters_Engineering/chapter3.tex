\chapter{Implementation}

The implementation of the design of this application followed an iterative methodology, with builds moving slowly towards the design that has been described in the previous chapter. This chapter will break the application's development into distinct iterations, with the initial iteration being what was considered the Minimum Viable Product - that being that the software had fulfilled the essential requirements and its core functionality had been implemented. Each iteration will include a subsection, that defines what was included in the design at that point. The final iteration will have included all facets of the design.

\section{Iteration I: Minimum Viable Product}
\subsection{Design}
The Minimum Viable Product for the purposes of this project was defined to be the successful completion of user stories 1 and 3 (see Appendix A). In this iteration, a user interface which includes a map, that has markers on it, is created, and the markers are able to be clicked on to show information about them. Two forms are also created in this iteration; one form to add a point of interest, and another to edit a given point of interest. Notably, no authentication or geocoding was present in this iteration, with any user being given the ability to add or edit a point of interest.
