\textbf{Please provide a brief summary of your project (150 word max)}

A web application that provides information about specific points of interest around the
Cors Dyfi Nature Reserve on a Google Maps API, with persistent data stored in a
PostgreSQL database. The application will be accessed on a computer based at the Dyfi
Wildlife Centre; its intention is for staff to more easily explain the work that the centre
carries out. Proposed data collection includes regular user experience surveys and
collaboration with staff at the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust regarding information
about the centre and local businesses/transport they wish to showcase. There has also
been a proposed task to include geospatial data from GNSS trackers that were placed on
western ospreys prior to the beginning of this project. The ospreys live at the nature
reserve and migrate to Africa during the winter.
