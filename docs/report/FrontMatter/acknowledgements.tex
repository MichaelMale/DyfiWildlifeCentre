I am grateful to Mr Emyr Evans and Mr Thomas Faulkner of the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust for their support in the development of this project, and hope that the final product is useful to them.

I'd like to thank my supervisor, Dr Edel Sherratt, for her help, support and encouragement during all stages of this project, as well as Mr Richard Shipman, who provided useful feedback in the mid-project demonstration that ensured the project was kept afloat.
