\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}


I'd like to thank my supervisor, Dr Edel Sherratt, for her support and advice throughout the project, which helped immensely.

I would also like to thank the Montgomeryshire Wildlife Trust and the Dyfi Osprey Project for their support and co-operation with this project.
